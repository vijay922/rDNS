# rDNS

A high-performance, concurrent reverse DNS lookup tool written in Go. Efficiently resolves IP addresses and CIDR ranges to domain names using multiple DNS resolvers and thousands of concurrent threads.

## Features

- üöÄ **High Concurrency**: Support for up to 10,000 concurrent threads
- üåê **CIDR Range Support**: Automatically expands CIDR ranges (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)
- üîÑ **Multiple DNS Resolvers**: Use custom resolvers or built-in public DNS servers
- ‚ö° **Performance Optimized**: Built-in rate limiting, timeouts, and retry mechanisms
- üìä **Progress Tracking**: Real-time statistics and progress reporting
- üéØ **Flexible Output**: Output to file or stdout, domains only or IP-domain pairs
- üõ°Ô∏è **Robust Error Handling**: Configurable timeouts, retries, and failure reporting

## Installation

### Quick Run
```bash
go install github.com/vijay922/rdns@latest

```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Resolve IPs from file using default resolvers
rdns -l iprange.txt -U

# High-performance bulk resolution
rdns -l iprange.txt -t 5000 -U -v

# Pipe single IP or CIDR
echo "8.8.8.8" | rdns -U
echo "192.168.1.0/24" | rdns -U -t 1000
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Save results to file with progress
rdns -l iprange.txt -t 5000 -U -v -o results.txt

# Use custom DNS resolver with TCP
rdns -l iprange.txt -r 1.1.1.1 -P tcp -t 2000

# Show only domain names, include failed IPs
rdns -l iprange.txt -U -d -f -t 3000

# Rate limited with custom timeout and retries
rdns -l iprange.txt -U -t 5000 -L 1000 -T 5 -y 3 -v
```

## Input File Formats

### IP List File (`iplist.txt`)
```
# Single IP addresses
8.8.8.8
1.1.1.1
208.67.222.222

# CIDR ranges (automatically expanded)
192.168.1.0/24
10.0.0.0/16
172.16.0.0/12

# Comments are ignored
# 203.0.113.0/24
```

### DNS Resolvers File (`resolvers.txt`)
```
1.1.1.1
8.8.8.8
9.9.9.9
208.67.222.222
# Custom resolver
192.168.1.1
```

## Built-in DNS Resolvers

rDNS includes popular public DNS resolvers:
- **Cloudflare**: 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1
- **Google**: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4
- **Quad9**: 9.9.9.9, 149.112.112.112
- **OpenDNS**: 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220
- **Verisign**: 64.6.64.6, 64.6.65.6
- And more...

## Performance Tuning

### System Limits
For high thread counts, you may need to increase system limits:
```bash
# Increase file descriptor limit
ulimit -n 65536

# For permanent changes, edit /etc/security/limits.conf
echo "* soft nofile 65536" >> /etc/security/limits.conf
echo "* hard nofile 65536" >> /etc/security/limits.conf
```

### Optimal Settings
```bash
# Fast scanning (recommended for most use cases)
rdns -l iprange.txt -t 2000 -U -v -L 5000

# Maximum performance (use with caution)
rdns -l iprange.txt -t 5000 -U -v -T 1 -y 1

# Conservative (for slower networks)
rdns -l iprange.txt -t 500 -U -v -T 5 -y 2 -L 1000
```

## Output Examples

### Standard Output
```
8.8.8.8         dns.google.
1.1.1.1         one.one.one.one.
208.67.222.222  resolver1.opendns.com.
```

### Domain-only Output (`-d`)
```
dns.google
one.one.one.one
resolver1.opendns.com
```

### With Failed IPs (`-f`)
```
8.8.8.8         dns.google.
192.168.1.1     FAILED
1.1.1.1         one.one.one.one.
```

## Examples

### Basic Reconnaissance
```bash
# Resolve a /24 network
echo "203.0.113.0/24" | ./rdns -U -t 1000 -v

# Bulk process multiple CIDR ranges
rdns -l networks.txt -U -t 3000 -v -o resolved_hosts.txt
```

### Security Research
```bash
# Find live hosts with reverse DNS
rdns -l target_ranges.txt -U -t 5000 -d -v -o domains.txt

# Check specific organization's IP space
echo "8.8.8.0/24" | ./rdns -U -t 500 -v
```

### Infrastructure Mapping
```bash
# Map cloud provider IP ranges
rdns -l aws_ranges.txt -U -t 2000 -v -o aws_hosts.txt

# Include failed resolutions for complete mapping
rdns -l datacenter_ips.txt -U -t 1000 -f -o complete_scan.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Too many open files**
```bash
ulimit -n 65536
```

**2. DNS queries timing out**
```bash
# Increase timeout and retries
rdns -l iprange.txt -U -T 5 -y 3
```

**3. Rate limiting by DNS servers**
```bash
# Add rate limiting
rdns -l iprange.txt -U -L 1000
```

**4. No results**
```bash
# Check with verbose output
rdns -l iprange.txt -U -v -f
```

### Performance Issues
- Start with 1000 threads and increase gradually
- Use rate limiting (`-L`) for large scans
- Consider using TCP (`-P tcp`) for better reliability
- Monitor system resources during large scans
